# C++ Ray-Tracer

This is a port of [python-ray-tracer](https://github.com/leomartinch/python-ray-tracer) to C++ to learn the language. 

## Features
- Path tracing
- OBJ loader (with materials)
- Smooth shading



## Installation

### Linux
```sh
git clone https://thing
cd to-thing/
```

### Windows

not tested


## Usage



> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must triangulate the mesh before exporting it to obj, as my ray tracer only supports triangles.

## Contribute

This project was created because I wanted to learn C++. There are several things I'd like to improve (see Issues tab).

If you have any suggestions on how I can improve the code I'd greatly appreciate it.
